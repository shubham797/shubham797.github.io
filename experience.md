## AI/ML Researcher (Systems Engineer)
### **TCS - Research & Innovation Labs, New Delhi, India**
#### _August 2018 - June 2021_

**[DeepReader](https://www.tcs.com/bridging-the-human-machine-divide) | POCs**
- Worked in information extraction from scanned legacy commercial documents having tabular structures. Module got appended as part of DeepReader.
- Developed and enhanced text information extraction pipeline by integrating and optimizing SOTA text detection modules.
- Developed a Graph Neural Network model to extract tabular structure (rows/columns) by exploiting table cells relationships.
- Deployed one-shot recognition model for entity detection in diagrams, by interpolating bezier spline over the diagram content, which was then used for sampling nodes for Graph Neural Network.
- Successfully completed multiple POCs for Visual elements data extraction from Industrial Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams. Developed SOTA fine-grained segmentation model for extraction and classification. Method is currently in patent pipeline.
- Worked on developing automated system of mining company sustainability reports from arbitrarily formatted PDF files.
- Developed automated Resume Information extraction system (non-templated mode).
