title: About me
subtitle: Allow me to introduce myself
---

I hail from an unpretentious industrial town of Uttar Pradesh, Renukoot. Very few people know about this place, which can be one possible reason why its so beautiful apart from nice people living here.

My bachelor’s and master’s degrees are from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad where I was working on mobile robots under guidance of my supervisior, Prof. [Dr. Rahul Kala](http://rkala.in/), who thankfully introduced me to computer vision and its applications in real world.

I am currently working as Senior ML/AI Researcher in Deep learning and Artificial intelligence group at TCS Research, New Delhi. My research area focuses on solving business problems using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. I am currently focussed over automated information extraction from camera-captured/scanned commercial documents. I am also actively engaged in solving segmentation problems from medical imaging.

Apart from my professional life, I am a Hatha & Kriya Yoga Practitioner. I do also have a professional certification from Govt. of India. I am also an active volunteer for environemental and social causes. In my spare time, I love visiting serene places of natural and scenic sights around India, and hopefully around world which's next in list :D.
