Hello, and Welcome! My name is Shubham, and I'm an AI researcher with a passion for exploring the world around us.
I hail from an unpretentious industrial town of Uttar Pradesh, a place blessed with natural scenic beauty.The landscape is marked by vast expanses of emerald green forests, tranquil waterfalls, and sparkling streams that meander through the hillsides. It's a place that is close to my heart, and I always feel a sense of calm and serenity whenever I visit. Growing up in such an environment has instilled in me a deep appreciation for the wonders of nature, and I often find myself seeking out new adventures in the great outdoors.

My bachelor’s and master’s degrees are from Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad where I was working on mobile robots under guidance of my supervisior, Prof. [Dr. Rahul Kala](http://rkala.in/), who thankfully introduced me to the fascinating world of AI & computer vision and its applications in real world.

I am currently working as Scientist in Deep learning and Artificial intelligence group at TCS Research, New Delhi. My research area focuses on solving business problems using computer vision and machine learning algorithms. I am currently focussed over designing and implementing new algorithms and techniques to optimize the performance of the chatGPT models. I am also actively engaged in solving segmentation problems from medical imaging. I'm constantly on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow, and I love collaborating with other researchers to push the boundaries of what's possible.

Apart from my professional life, I am a Hatha Yoga & Kriya Yoga Practitioner. I do also have a professional certification from Govt. of India. I am also an active volunteer for environemental and social causes. In my spare time, I love to travel and explore new places. I have a particular interest in visiting locations with scenic beauty, as I find that being surrounded by natural wonders can be both invigorating and inspiring. I believe that there is so much to learn from the world around us, and I always come back from my travels with a fresh perspective and renewed enthusiasm for my work.

Thank you for taking the time to learn a little more about me, and I look forward to connecting with you soon!
